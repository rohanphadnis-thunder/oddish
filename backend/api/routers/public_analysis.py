"""Public (unauthenticated) analysis reads for shared experiments.

These live here rather than beside their siblings in
``oddish/core/sharing/public.py`` because they are backend routes; the
share-token resolvers they use come from the ``oddish`` package, which is
the allowed import direction.

Summaries are written onto ``trials.trajectory_summary`` by a task QA import
or an explicit summarize-trial import. This public route is a plain stored
column read and never starts generation.
