"""Browser cache policy for reads the dashboard fetches directly.

While the dashboard reached the backend through its Next.js ``/api/*`` proxy
routes, those routes set ``Cache-Control`` on a handful of responses (file
listings that carry 15-minute presigned URLs, the dashboard summary, the
member list). With ``NEXT_PUBLIC_API_DIRECT`` the browser talks to this API
itself, so the same policy has to come from here. Keyed on the matched route
template rather than the URL so a path parameter can never widen a match, and
applied only when the handler set nothing itself (the task-file content route
sets its own ``ETag`` / ``no-cache`` pair).
