"""Oddish's Claude Code agent wrappers.

All Claude Code trials deliver the task over stdin so task text is absent from
the process command line -- upstream Harbor does this itself now, so the
wrappers no longer patch the command. Probe trials additionally install Harbor
into the sandbox so the agent can inspect the harness.

Stock Harbor installs only the claude-code CLI into the sandbox (see
``harbor.agents.installed.claude_code.ClaudeCode.install``). Probe trials also
want the *harbor* package importable inside the sandbox so the agent can
``import harbor`` while exploring the harness. We pin the install to the exact
harbor the orchestrator is running -- read from the installed package's PEP 610
``direct_url.json`` (harbor is a git fork, not a PyPI release) and rendered as
a requirement the sandbox can actually install: probe sandbox images ship no
``git`` binary, so GitHub sources become a commit tarball rather than a
``git+`` reference. In a blessed-variant container that is the variant's
harbor; for an explicit override the caller can pass ``(source, sha)``.

The wrappers are selected by ``_apply_claude_code_oddish_wrapper`` in
:mod:`oddish.workers.harbor.agent_config`.
