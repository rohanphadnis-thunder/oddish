"""Dispatcher helpers that read from the unified `worker_jobs` table.

Replaces the three-way union the legacy dispatcher used to do over
trials / trial-analyses / task-verdicts. Active kinds share the same
``DISTINCT queue_key`` / ``GROUP BY queue_key`` queries; historical enum-only
kinds are excluded by the shared ``ACTIVE_WORKER_JOB_KINDS`` definition.

The planner rotates organizations, then gives positive-priority analysis jobs
three turns for each ordinary turn within an organization. Hosted dispatch
persists those turns and reserves the existing queue_slots before calling Modal.
All priority classes, organizations, variants, and lanes share the model cap.
