"""Single-job runner over the unified `worker_jobs` table.

The only dispatcher path after the cutover from the legacy
per-kind claim SQLs. Kind-agnostic: claims one row with
``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`` and hands it to the registered
``JobHandler`` for the row's ``kind``.

All scheduling-state transitions (``QUEUED`` / ``RETRYING`` →
``RUNNING`` → ``SUCCESS`` / ``RETRYING`` / ``FAILED``) happen here.
Handlers still do their own domain writes (``trials.status``,
``tasks.verdict`` ...) inside ``JobHandler.run``; the runner only
touches ``worker_jobs``.

# Claim SQL
#
# Single query replaces the three kind-specific claim SQLs in the
# legacy ``single_job.py``. Fair-scheduling-across-users for the
# TRIAL kind is expressed via a LEFT JOIN that degenerates to a no-op
# for every other kind, so the query is genuinely kind-agnostic at
# the surface:
#
#   - For TRIAL rows, the JOIN resolves the trial's fairness_key and
#     the subquery counts per-user RUNNING trials for this queue_key;
#     ORDER BY then prefers the least-loaded user.
#   - For non-TRIAL rows the JOINs produce NULLs and rpg.running_count
#     is 0 for every row, so ORDER BY collapses to
#     ``priority DESC, created_at ASC`` (plain FIFO with priority).

    a long job blows the budget on its first iteration and so still runs
    one-per-container, while short jobs pack many into one slot lease. The slot
