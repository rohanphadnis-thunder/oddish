"""The host-agnostic dispatch loop (design spec §5.2).

The **core** owns discovery, spawn-plan math, per-poll caps, the pre-spawn
admission gate, and the wake trigger; a ``Dispatcher`` only runs / observes /
cancels workers. Modal's ``poll_queue`` cron and the standalone server both
drive ``run_dispatch_cycle`` with their own ``Dispatcher`` — so the scheduling
brain is identical everywhere and only the fan-out primitive differs.

Trigger: an **event-driven wake** on enqueue / slot-release, with the timed
poll demoted to a *fallback* (still required for ``available_after`` retries).
The in-app signal works whenever the API and dispatcher share a process (the
standalone server, the Docker stack); on Modal they are separate containers, so
the signal is a no-op there and the cron/fallback poll remains — exactly the
documented interim that sidesteps the Supavisor LISTEN/NOTIFY caveat.
