"""get_read_session: autocommit reads with no transaction round-trips.

``get_read_session`` exists so read-only endpoints stop paying
BEGIN/COMMIT round-trips to a pooler that sits a network hop away. These
tests pin its two contracts against a real database: statements really do
run outside any enclosing transaction (each in its own implicit one), and
the soft-delete auto-filter still applies because it is keyed on the
Session class, not on transaction handling.
