"""Shared pytest fixtures and configuration.

pytest-asyncio gives each test function its own event loop. The SQLAlchemy
asyncpg engine is created at import time and is loop-bound once it opens a
connection, so a second async test that reuses the module-level engine fails
with "Event loop is closed". This autouse fixture recreates the engine before
every test so each test gets a fresh engine bound to its own loop.

The recreated engine uses NullPool (no pooled connections) so recreating it per
test leaks nothing -- connections are opened and closed per use.
